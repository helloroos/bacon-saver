# Background and Overview 
The MVP (Most Valuable Planner) is a tool that helps groups to plan around dates by visualizing overlapping schedule availabilities. 

Users can create a plan, invite participants and set a date range that participants can choose from. Invited participants can indicate their availability from the list of dates given.
