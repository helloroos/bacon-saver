# Saved Your Bacon
# Background and Overview 
20% of the US waste stream is food waste. Most landfills are so tightly packed, they create an environment free of oxygen, which makes it very difficult (and sometimes impossible) for food items  to biodegrade properly. Instead, these items degrade without oxygen and methane gas is released as a byproduct. Methane is anywhere from 20-150 times more potent of a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide over a 100 year timeframe, which is why minimizing food waste is so crucial.

Saved Your Bacon is a recipe tool that allows users to browse for recipes based on food items they have at home that might be close to perishing.
